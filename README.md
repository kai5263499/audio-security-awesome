# Datasets
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here are a collection of audio datasets for training new models

### [Google Audio Set](https://research.google.com/audioset/index.html)

### [Urban Sound Dataset](https://serv.cusp.nyu.edu/projects/urbansounddataset/)
* Contains urban sound tags like birds, car horns, etc

### [RAVDESS](https://smartlaboratory.org/ravdess)
* The Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song
* Contains emotion tags

### [LJ Speech](https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/)
* 13,100 short audio clips of a single speaker reading passages from 7 non-fiction books
* Sourced from the LibriVox project

### [Blizzard Challenge 2017](https://synsig.org/index.php/Blizzard_Challenge_2017)
* Data comes from professional audiobooks produced by Usborne Publishing

### [CSTR VCTK Corpus](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/jyamagis/page3/page58/page58.html)
* This CSTR VCTK Corpus includes speech data uttered by 109 native speakers of English with various accents. Each speaker reads out about 400 sentences, most of which were selected from a newspaper plus the Rainbow Passage and an elicitation paragraph intended to identify the speaker's accent.
* All speech data was recorded using an identical recording setup: an omni-directional head-mounted microphone (DPA 4035), 96kHz sampling frequency at 24 bits and in a hemi-anechoic chamber of the University of Edinburgh.

# Speech To Text
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Mozilla Deep Speech](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech)
* A TensorFlow implementation of Baidu's DeepSpeech architecture

### [CMUSphinx](https://cmusphinx.github.io/)
* Research project from the Carnegie Mellon University
* [Golang library](https://github.com/xlab/pocketsphinx-go)
* [Python library](https://github.com/cmusphinx/pocketsphinx-python)

# Text to Speech
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Tacotron](https://github.com/keithito/tacotron)
* Based on a Google published paper published in April 2017, [Tacotron: Towards End-to-End Speech Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10135.pdf), where they present a neural text-to-speech model that learns to synthesize speech directly from (text, audio) pairs.
* An implementation of Tacotron speech synthesis in TensorFlow

### [Wavenet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WaveNet)
* WaveNet is a deep neural network for generating raw audio. It was created by researchers at London-based artificial intelligence firm DeepMind. The technique, outlined in a paper in September 2016,[1] is able to generate more realistic-sounding human-like voices by sampling real human speech and directly modelling waveforms.

# Commercial Services
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sometimes open source projects either aren't up to par or a service with greater compute resources behind it makes more sense for a project.

### [Lyrebird](https://lyrebird.ai/)
* Free voice cloning service

### [Snowboy Kitt AI](https://snowboy.kitt.ai/)
* [Snowboy Go Wrapper](https://github.com/brentnd/go-snowboy)

### [IBM Watson Speech to Text](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-speech-to-text)
* Free usage tier
* Otherwise $.0125/min
* Requires text to be chunked so you'll need to split it along pauses

### [Amazon Polly](https://aws.amazon.com/polly/)
* Free usage tier
* Something like $0.10/min - Not cheap

### [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/upload)
* Automatically transcribes speech to text for free!

### [Copsonic](https://www.copsonic.com/)
* Various audio security services. Use with caution.
